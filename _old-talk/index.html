						If I invite someone, with the same level of enthusiasm as I have.<br>

						Then we can find our own challenges in the project, and probably stimulate each other to actually finish it<br>
						So I found this victim, and we where like all happy<br>
						And because of the years of programming experience differences, we decided to make it in python on the raspberry pi<br>
						The victim did not really had enough time at that moment<br>
						So we had to postpone starting until a later date

				<section data-background-image="./img/energic.jpg">

						So I needed to do something with this energy
					</aside>

				<section data-background-image="./img/game-programming.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						And then again, i felt back into game programming.<br>
						I decided to pick the most difficult game from the list of games that I would like for the table<br>

						I though if I could make Boulder Dash in Elm, a pure functional language. Then I can probably make any of those games in python<br>
						Who has played this game?<br>

						Remember we are building a game for a 12 by 12 led table. This is all the graphics you can get.<br>

					<aside class="notes">
						Every game programming book I have is in an imperative programming style.<br>
						Most of them in c++ but other languages like Java follow the same patterns.<br>
						I was learning the functional paradigm and played with Elm for a few years.<br>
						And I wanted to try to see how it would be to create a game in Elm.<br>
						To learn from an experiment.<br>
						Who has used elm?

						Elm is a bit different then javascript, where Elm transpiles to.<br>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Some of the characteristics of Elm is that it is a Pure Functional language, Its statically and stronly typed.<br>
						Which allows the compiler to complain when I'm doing things wrong again<br>
						But its complains are often so clear that you can learn a lot from the compiler<br>
						And its a Frontend only language

						A simple function in elm looks like this<br>
						We have the name of the function `add`<br>
						The arguments `x` and `y`<br>

					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-02.png" class="plain">

						Now everything in Elm is typed and you can annotate the function with its types<br>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-03.png" class="plain">

						Applying functions is done by spaces.<br>

					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-04.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Everything in Elm is curried. Therefor you can call a function with less then all arguments<br>

						When you create games you can look at it as if you are directing movies.<br>

						I did not like the white background therefor I added a background image.<br>

				<section data-background-image="./img/time.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">

						To make the game come alive, you need to add some notion of time

					<h2>Game Loop</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						And that is what we call the Game Loop<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A very simplistic one is this, update the game, and then sleep for some time<br>
						And keep doing that forever<br>
						Code samples with white background are pseudo code in a C like style<br>
						<br>
						This update function will be called once a second.<br>
						In which you will then update your game state.
					</aside>

				<section data-state="game-loop-1-section">
					<video id="game-loop-1-video" controls autoplay>
						<source src="./img/game-loop-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						Your browser does not support the video tag.

						$(document).ready(function () {

								$('#game-loop-1-video').currentTime = 0;
								$('#game-loop-1-video').load();
							}, false);
						});
					</script>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now if we let the actors move one tile each update then that will look like this

				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The game moves very slow and we can fix that to lower the sleep time.<br>
						17 milliseconds will give us about 60 updates per second
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now we are not really calling update every 17ms.<br>
						We forgot to take into account the time it took to run `update`<br>
						If update takes about 10ms then together with sleep we only call update about once in the 27ms<br>
						You can fix that by subtracting the time it took from the sleep
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Another option would be to check how much time has passed since the last update<br>
						And use that as some kind of delta time in update<br>
						Than within update you check how much actors must move based on the delta time<br>
						An disadvantage of this is that too much time might have passed. And actor might jump pass walls
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A safer bet is to have a stable update call. Which makes it unable for your game to make giant jumps on slow computers<br>
						If you split the update and view. You can do multiple update ticks in case too much time has passed the last loop.<br>
						To let the game `catch up`. At the cost of drawing the game less frequent. Which we will see as "frame drops"<br>
						But at least the hero did not cheat by running past a wall
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
				  	<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Elm is a pure functional language and asking for the time is an impure operation.<br>
						Time has this habit of changing a lot<br>
						In order to get some time information you need to setup something called "Subscriptions"<br>
						Which allows mechanisms outside of your app to send `Messages` which you can handle in a pure fashion.<br>
						We define a message, setup a subscription to get that message every 17 milliseconds<br>
						And handle the message
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          			<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						We are running in the browser and the browser has some mechanism to redraw the screen.<br>
						And to make animations look smoother we can kinda hook into that redraw mechanism<br>
						We can do something similar as we did with time but then based on the browsers animation frame<br>
						This time we get the amount of milliseconds passed instead of a "stable 17ms" like we had with time<br>
						And therefor we should be doing some math instead of calling the update function everytime
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          			<img src="./img/game-loop-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Remembering our game loop. We would like to update on a stable 17 millisecond.<br>
						For as many 17 milliseconds since we did our last loop<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						You do not have for loops in Elm but we can create a List of a certain length and iterate over it<br>
						Which we do with List.repeat<br>
						We determine how often the 17ms has passed and create a list of the same length<br>
						Because we need to update the game based on the previous update. We can fold over our list and use our model as the accumulator<br>
						This will give us the sketched game loop
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						We can improve the game loop by limiting the amount of updates per "view".<br>
						We do this to not make it look like our hero jumped far because of a game hickup<br>
						This is easy by just taking x elements from our repeated list
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Finally we should keep track of how many time we had left. Like 3ms if the timeSinceLast was 20ms.<br>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-6.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						After the `update` function returned our new model, elm will call our view function again<br>

					<h2>Actors</h2>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						You will have actors for about everything in the game<br>
						Like we have a Hero and an Enemy<br>
						Which both have an `update` function.<br>
						Which should be called from the main loop
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						You add all the behaviours in those classes like walking and collection diamonds for our hero.<br>
						And walking and killing heroes for the enemy
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						After a while you will end up with more and more actors<br>
						Like a butterfly, which is an AI just like our Enemy but then being super cute instead of trying to kill the hero
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This goes on and on and you end up with lots of actors which update functions get really big and messy<br>
						Also you will notice you get lots of duplicate behaviour among your actors.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A solution in the object oriented world could be to introduce some form of inheritance<br>
						Which is actually not really reusable and might give us "Diamonds of deaths"<br>
						Like I have no clue how this update function would look like
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-6.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Another more reusable approach would be to put the behavior in separate places, which we called components here<br>
						And assign components to actors. Like our hero has the WalkComponent and CollectComponent or whatever<br>
						And we would give our enemy the KillComponent.<br>
						This way we can easily mix and match components and thereby create new actors with less effort
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>Composition over Inheritance</h3>
					<img src="./img/composition-over-inheritance.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The benefits of Composition over Inheritance<br>
						This is nice because we do not have inheritance in Elm anyway hehe<br>
						Elm can do the composition which we call the Actor Component system in game programming<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-actor-component-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						In Elm we can create our own type which we call Component<br>
						And Component can by any of those specified options<br>
						Its a bit like an Enum.<br>
						Components can hold data like we give a String to TagComponent to represent the tag name<br>
						And its can also have custom type or type aliases. Like we create some TransformComponentData record with x and y positions for the transform.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-actor-component-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Once we have our components we can mix and match them to create actors.<br>
						We define an actor as just a list of components and we create our hero and enemy.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-actor-component-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now a little sidetrack<br>
						ControllerInputComponent and WalkAiComponent kinda do the same thing. They control the actors movement etc<br>
						Those components just do it in their own way, via collected input or some ai logic<br>
						We could group them together under one ControlComponent to make it clearer that you should not have both<br>
						Also you can keep giving data to your types like we give some AiSettings to ControlType

					<h2>Implementing behaviour</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Types in Elm are just data. They are not like objects which can have function and behaviour<br>
						In other words, our components do not do anything yet.<br>
						We need to add functions for their behaviours<br>

						Here we have a very naive walking implementation for the WalkAiComponent<br>
						Which will just make the actor move to the right<br>
						We receive the actor that holds this component and we will need to fetch the transformComponent from the actor<br>
						Because the transform holds its current position<br>
						After that we will walk one position to the right. Which will create a new transform component<br>
						Which in turn needs to overwrite the current transform component of the actor<br>
						Finally if the actor did not have a transform component then we will return the actor as we received it

				<section>

						This function will try to get the TransformComponentData from the actor. But he might not have any therefor we return a Maybe.

						Every game tick we would like to iterate over the actors to glue the actor component system with the main loop.<br>
						Because components can change their actor we need to do some folding<br>
						We fold over all the actors and let them call updateActor on each<br>
						Then we call the corresponding update for all components on the actor<br>
						Those components might have changed the actor therefor we need to update the actor in the accumulator, which is the list of actors

						Another performance optimization is that I'm not actually creating the view, when the view method of elm gets called<br>

					<h2>Toughest Lesson Learned</h2>

						To close I would like to share the toughest lesson learned which was most definitely keeping track of what your "newest" actor/level or model is<br>
						I have had a few times that I was like wtf is going on why is not this working<br>
						And then the conclusion was that I did not update the actor in the accumulated level and there for changes where lost etc<br>
